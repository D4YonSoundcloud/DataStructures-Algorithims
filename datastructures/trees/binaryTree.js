//what is a tree?
//a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
//root is the top most node
//nodes can reference multiple nodes which can reference other nodes, etc
//trees are nonlinear, compared to list which are linear
//nodes can only point to a child
//NOT a parent/child relationship
//can only have one root
//child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
//siblings have the same parents
//leaf have no children
//edge is the connection between one node and the other
//rule world uses HTML DOM, network routing,syntax tree, artifical intellegience 
//folders in operating systems, JSON

//kinds of trees
//trees
//binary trees parents can only have two children
//binary search trees ( BST  ) || are sorted // every node left is always less than the right
